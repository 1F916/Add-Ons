# FrankerFaceZ Add-Ons

This is the official repository for [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/)
Add-Ons. Add-Ons are additional scripts that users can choose to load to add
additional functionality to FrankerFaceZ and Twitch.

All Add-Ons available through FrankerFaceZ have their source code
available here.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy the `src/example` directory, making a new directory within `src` with
   the name of your extension.
3. Make the rest of your extension.
4. When you're ready, set `enabled` to `true` in your extension's manifest, then
   submit a pull request to bring your code into this repository's master branch.
5. Once your code is accepted, the new extension will automatically be built,
   uploaded, and sent to end-users.

## Documentation

Unfortunately, we lack significant documentation at this time. Please study the
source code of existing add-ons for examples, and the source of FFZ itself.
